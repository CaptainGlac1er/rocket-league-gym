.. py:class:: EventReward(goal=0.0, team_goal=0.0, concede=-0.0, touch=0.0, shot=0.0, save=0.0, demo=0.0, boost_pickup=0.0)

   Bases: :py:obj:`rlgym.utils.reward_functions.RewardFunction`

   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

      :staticmethod:


   .. py:method:: reset(initial_state: rlgym.utils.gamestates.GameState, optional_data=None)

      Function to be called each time the environment is reset. This is meant to enable users to design stateful reward
      functions that maintain information about the game throughout an episode to determine a reward.

      :param initial_state: The initial state of the reset environment.


   .. py:method:: get_reward(player: rlgym.utils.gamestates.PlayerData, state: rlgym.utils.gamestates.GameState, previous_action: numpy.ndarray, optional_data=None)

      Function to compute the reward for a player. This function is given a player argument, and it is expected that
      the reward returned by this function will be for that player.

      :param player: Player to compute the reward for.
      :param state: The current state of the game.
      :param previous_action: The action taken at the previous environment step.

      :return: A reward for the player provided.



.. py:class:: VelocityReward(negative=False)

   Bases: :py:obj:`rlgym.utils.reward_functions.RewardFunction`

   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

      :param initial_state: The initial state of the reset environment.


   .. py:method:: get_reward(player: rlgym.utils.gamestates.PlayerData, state: rlgym.utils.gamestates.GameState, previous_action: numpy.ndarray) -> float

      Function to compute the reward for a player. This function is given a player argument, and it is expected that
      the reward returned by this function will be for that player.

      :param player: Player to compute the reward for.
      :param state: The current state of the game.
      :param previous_action: The action taken at the previous environment step.
