.. py:class:: DefaultAction

   Bases: :py:obj:`rlgym.utils.action_parsers.ContinuousAction`

   Continuous Action space, that also accepts a few other input formats for QoL reasons and to remain
   compatible with older versions.

   .. py:method:: get_action_space()

      Function that returns the action space type. It will be called during the initialization of the environment.

      :return: The type of the action space


   .. py:method:: parse_actions(actions, state)

      Function that parses actions from the action space into a format that rlgym understands.
      The expected return value is a numpy float array of size (n, 8) where n is the number of agents.
      The second dimension is indexed as follows: throttle, steer, yaw, pitch, roll, jump, boost, handbrake.
      The first five values are expected to be in the range [-1, 1], while the last three values should be either 0 or 1.

      :param actions: An object of actions, as passed to the `env.step` function.
      :param state: The GameState object of the current state that were used to generate the actions.

      :return: the parsed actions in the rlgym format.
